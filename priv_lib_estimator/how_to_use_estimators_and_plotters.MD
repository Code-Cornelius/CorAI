This is a tutorial on the how to use the classes from this library.

Estimators and Plotters are an efficient way to use dataframes. 
Dataframes from pandas are simple containers that lack some global 
structure and efficient ways to plot data.
In order to fill this gap, estimators are wrappers around dataframes that $
allow storing metadata and grant some useful methods. 
Also, sometimes dataframe's extremely flexible structure shall be restricted
and one would wish to enforce a given pattern for all dataset of the same type.
This is doable with estimators.

On the other hand, plotters contain estimators and offer an automatic way to plot
certain type of representation of the data.
